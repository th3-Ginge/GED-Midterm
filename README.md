Question 3 Game Designer
Change the final score based on the amount of life bars when completing the level.

To accomplish this i would create a singleton that is initilized when the level first load that will keep track of the amount of bars the player has and takes them away as the time decreased. because the singleton would be assesble be any part in the scene many functions could call on it to check how much time is left and how many bares should be appering on the screen. The reson that the singleton would be initilized on straatup of the level is so that it is already made and i do not need to make cases and exeptions in each function that will try to make it as i know multiple functions such as timer,asset manager(to dispay the bars)will all need the singleton right at the beginning of the level and function/classes like a score manager to tally up the amount of bares remaining at the ned of the level and add them to the total score. So creating the sigleton at the beginning and allowing it ot do its proccess uniteruped for the enteriety of the level until it is called upon is ideal.
The reason that the singleton was chosen to be used in this way is so that istead of having all the different function and classes required to keep track of the bars show them on the screen and tally them up at the end talking to eachother back and forth having all the information go through the single ton means each class only has to call on and report to the singleton to get the information that they need to accomplish their task instead of calling mutiple classes, this saves proccessing power and allows for more streamlined information sharing.
This choice suits the game as it allows for easy and centralized infortmation sharing for the players remaining time, with the singleton in place and the singleton could be expanded for increased capabilities depending on feture that could be implemented into the game
